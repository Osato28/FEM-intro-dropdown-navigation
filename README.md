# Questions for others doing this challenge:

- Is there a better way to make all images in the client-logos section look equal? Making them all equal width or height results in an uneven look, so I had to resort to magic numbers (linked to vw to make them scale) and justify-content: space-between.
- The way main menu's positioning in the mobile version is done (absolute positioning for the main menu and the icon, then a magical number on the second ) is a terrible mess. Does anyone know a better way to do it?
